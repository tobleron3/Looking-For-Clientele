Automated moderation can be an effective first line of defense to quickly and extensively filter inappropriate content. We can use commercially available AI services that specialize in detecting inappropriate content such as nudity, offensive language, and violence.

    Choosing an AI Service Provider: Select a provider that offers an API for content moderation, like AWS Rekognition, Google Cloud Vision API, or Microsoft Azure Content Moderator.

    Integrating the Content Moderation API:
    Implement a function that calls the selected provider's API before allowing content to be posted on the platform.

Step 2: Human Moderation

Human moderation is crucial for reviewing content flagged by users or the automated moderation system. This ensures that content in gray areas is reviewed with contextual and cultural understanding.

    Moderation Panel for Reviewers:
    Develop a user interface that allows human reviewers to see reported content, make decisions about its appropriateness, and take necessary actions, such as removing content or warning the user.

    User Content Reporting Process:
    Implement a function that allows users to report content they consider inappropriate, which automatically marks it for review by the human moderation team.

Technical Implementation

Integrating with an AI Service for Content Moderation:

Assuming a generic integration with a service like AWS Rekognition for inappropriate image detection.

javascript

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

const rekognition = new AWS.Rekognition();

function checkContentForInappropriateness(imageBytes) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const params = {
      Image: {
        Bytes: imageBytes
      },
      MinConfidence: 70
    };
    
    rekognition.detectModerationLabels(params, function(err, data) {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
      } else {
        resolve(data.ModerationLabels);
      }
    });
  });
}

Moderation Panel for Reviewers:

Developing a complete user interface for human moderation exceeds this format, but involves creating admin views where moderators can review content, see reports, and take actions.
User Reporting Process:

javascript

app.post('/report-content', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  const { userId, contentId, reason } = req.body;

  try {
    // Assuming the existence of a 'reports' table to store the reports
    await pool.query('INSERT INTO reports (userId, contentId, reason) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)', [userId, contentId, reason]);
    res.send('Content reported successfully');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
  }
});
