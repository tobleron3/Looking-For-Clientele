Step 1: Age Verification Process Design

For age verification, opting to integrate third-party services that provide reliable identity and age checks is advisable. These services can help automate the process while maintaining high levels of accuracy and security.

    Choosing an Age Verification Service Provider: Select a provider like Veriff, Jumio, or another that complies with local and international regulations.

    Integrating the Age Verification Service: Implement the API of the chosen provider in the registration flow or access to adult content on the platform.

Step 2: Obtaining Explicit Consent

It is important to ensure that users understand the type of content they will be viewing and that they give their informed consent.

    Designing a Consent Form: Create a clear and concise form that describes the nature of the content. This form should require an affirmative action by the user, such as ticking a box, to indicate their consent.

    Securely Storing Consent: Record the user's consent in the database in a way that it is associated with their profile, ensuring that their consent can be audited if necessary.
