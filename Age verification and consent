Step 1: Age Verification Process Design

For age verification, opting to integrate third-party services that provide reliable identity and age checks is advisable. These services can help automate the process while maintaining high levels of accuracy and security.

     

    Integrating the Age Verification Service: Implement the API of the chosen provider in the registration flow or access to adult content on the platform.

Step 2: Obtaining Explicit Consent

It is important to ensure that users understand the type of content they will be viewing and that they give their informed consent.

    Designing a Consent Form: Create a clear and concise form that describes the nature of the content. This form should require an affirmative action by the user, such as ticking a box, to indicate their consent.

    Securely Storing Consent: Record the user's consent in the database in a way that it is associated with their profile, ensuring that their consent can be audited if necessary.

DIY approaches:

    Develop a custom age verification system using common web development frameworks (like React, Angular, or Vue.js). You can set up a simple form asking users to enter their birthdate, and then verify if the age meets the legal requirements for accessing adult content.
    For consent management, you can create a straightforward agreement form or pop-up that explains the terms of content consumption and requires user acceptance before proceeding.

Ensure that your age verification and consent management tools comply with local and international laws such as COPPA in the U.S., GDPR in Europe, and other specific regulations governing adult content.
